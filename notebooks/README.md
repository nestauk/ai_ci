# Notebook section

Notebooks `01`, `02`, `03` and `04` contain stubs for each data source.

You can use them to get the data and start exploring it.

More specifically...

* `01` - download the GtR data for the gdrive I will share with you.
* `02` - patents - as above
* `03` - arXiv - get the data using a nesta `data_getter`. Before doing that, you need to install it using the instructions [here](https://github.com/nestauk/data_getters).
* `04` - crunchBase as `03`

I would suggest putting all data in the `data/external` folder. 

I will share with you via email the `config` file required to query our AWS, and the folder with the GtR and patent data
